description: Skills are reusable capability definitions that extend what your agent can do. They provide structured prompts, instructions, and context that help the agent perform specific tasks effectively.

## What are Skills?

Skills are markdown files (typically `SKILL.md`) that define:

- **Name and description** - What the skill does
- **Instructions** - Detailed guidance for the agent
- **Context** - Domain-specific knowledge
- **Examples** - Sample inputs and outputs

When loaded, skills are injected into the agent's system prompt, giving it specialized capabilities without modifying your code.

## Skill Discovery

Zypher Agent automatically discovers skills from multiple locations, with a clear precedence order:

1. **Custom directories** - Paths specified via `customSkillsDirs` option (highest priority)
2. **Project skills** - `.skills/` directory in the working directory
3. **Global skills** - `~/.zypher/skills/` directory (lowest priority)

Skills with the same name are deduplicated, with higher-priority locations taking precedence.

```typescript
const agent = await createZypherAgent({
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  config: {
    skills: {
      customSkillsDirs: ["./my-skills", "/shared/team-skills"],
    },
  },
});
```

## Creating Skills

### Basic Skill Format

Create a subdirectory for your skill and add a `SKILL.md` file inside it (e.g., `.skills/code-reviewer/SKILL.md`):

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality, security, and best practices
---

# Code Review Skill

You are an expert code reviewer. When reviewing code:

## Review Checklist

1. **Security** - Check for vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, etc.)
2. **Performance** - Identify potential bottlenecks
3. **Readability** - Ensure clear naming and structure
4. **Best Practices** - Follow language-specific conventions
5. **Error Handling** - Verify proper error management

## Output Format

Provide feedback in this format:

### Summary
Brief overview of the code quality.

### Issues Found
- [SEVERITY] Description of issue
- Location: file:line

### Suggestions
Numbered list of improvements.

### Overall Assessment
Final verdict: APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or NEEDS_DISCUSSION
```

### Skill Metadata

The frontmatter supports these fields:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name          # Unique identifier (required)
description: Brief desc   # Short description (required)
license: MIT              # Optional license
compatibility: ">=1.0.0"  # Optional version compatibility
allowed-tools: "Bash,Read" # Optional allowed tools for the skill
metadata:                 # Optional custom key-value pairs
  category: code-quality
  priority: high
---
```

## Using Skills

### Where to Place Skills

Each skill must be in its own **subdirectory** containing a `SKILL.md` file. Place skill directories in one of these locations (in order of precedence):

| Location | Description | Example Path |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Custom directories | Specified via `customSkillsDirs` option | `./my-skills/code-reviewer/SKILL.md` |
| Project skills | `.skills/` in working directory | `./.skills/code-reviewer/SKILL.md` |
| Global skills | `~/.zypher/skills/` | `~/.zypher/skills/code-reviewer/SKILL.md` |

When skill names conflict, higher-precedence locations override lower ones.

### How Skills are Loaded

Skills are automatically discovered when you create an agent. The agent scans all configured skill directories for subdirectories containing `SKILL.md` files:

```typescript
const agent = await createZypherAgent({
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  config: {
    skills: {
      // Optional: add custom skill directories (highest precedence)
      customSkillsDirs: ["./my-skills"],
    },
  },
});

// Skills are now loaded and available
// List all discovered skills
console.log(agent.skills.skills);

// Get a specific skill by name
const reviewSkill = agent.skills.getSkill("code-reviewer");
console.log(reviewSkill?.metadata.description);

// Get the formatted XML prompt (automatically included in system prompt)
console.log(agent.skills.skillsPrompt);
```

### Skills in System Prompt

Skills are automatically included in the agent's system prompt in XML format:

```xml
<available_skills>
<skill>
<name>code-reviewer</name>
<description>Reviews code for quality, security, and best practices</description>
<location>.skills/code-reviewer/SKILL.md</location>
</skill>
</available_skills>
```

The agent can then reference and use these skills when performing tasks. The `location` field shows the path to the skill file (relative if inside the working directory, absolute otherwise).

## Skill Organization

Each skill must be in its own subdirectory containing a `SKILL.md` file (or `skill.md` as fallback).

### Project Skills

For project-specific skills, create a `.skills/` directory in your project root:

```text
my-project/
├── .skills/
│   ├── code-reviewer/
│   │   └── SKILL.md          # Code review skill
│   ├── code-style/
│   │   └── SKILL.md          # Code style guidelines
│   └── api-design/
│       └── SKILL.md          # API design patterns
├── src/
└── deno.json
```

### Global Skills

For skills you want available across all projects:

```text
~/.zypher/
└── skills/
    ├── general-coding/
    │   └── SKILL.md          # General coding assistance
    ├── documentation/
    │   └── SKILL.md          # Documentation writing
    └── testing/
        └── SKILL.md          # Test writing patterns
```

### Custom Skills

Add custom skill directories for shared or project-specific skills:

```typescript
import { existsSync } from "node:fs";

const skillDirs = ["/shared/team-skills"];
if (existsSync("./tsconfig.json")) {
  skillDirs.push("./skills/typescript");
}

const agent = await createZypherAgent({
  model: "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
  config: {
    skills: { customSkillsDirs: skillDirs },
  },
});
```
